Here's a fun Java project idea: Library Management System

This is a simple console-based project where you can manage books and users in a library. The system allows adding books, viewing available books, borrowing, and returning books.

Features:
Add new books to the library
View all available books
Borrow books (mark as unavailable)
Return books (mark as available)
Hereâ€™s the Java code for the Library Management System:

java
Copy

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Scanner;

class Book {
    private String title;
    private String author;
    private boolean isAvailable;

    public Book(String title, String author) {
        this.title = title;
        this.author = author;
        this.isAvailable = true;
    }

    public String getTitle() {
        return title;
    }

    public String getAuthor() {
        return author;
    }

    public boolean isAvailable() {
        return isAvailable;
    }

    public void borrowBook() {
        if (isAvailable) {
            isAvailable = false;
            System.out.println("You have successfully borrowed: " + title);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Sorry, this book is currently not available.");
        }
    }

    public void returnBook() {
        isAvailable = true;
        System.out.println("You have successfully returned: " + title);
    }

    public void displayBook() {
        System.out.println(title + " by " + author + " | " + (isAvailable ? "Available" : "Borrowed"));
    }
}

class Library {
    private ArrayList<Book> books = new ArrayList<>();

    public void addBook(String title, String author) {
        books.add(new Book(title, author));
        System.out.println("Book added: " + title);
    }

    public void viewBooks() {
        if (books.isEmpty()) {
            System.out.println("No books available in the library.");
            return;
        }
        System.out.println("\nLibrary Books:");
        for (Book book : books) {
            book.displayBook();
        }
    }

    public void borrowBook(String title) {
        for (Book book : books) {
            if (book.getTitle().equalsIgnoreCase(title)) {
                book.borrowBook();
                return;
            }
        }
        System.out.println("Book not found.");
    }

    public void returnBook(String title) {
        for (Book book : books) {
            if (book.getTitle().equalsIgnoreCase(title)) {
                book.returnBook();
                return;
            }
        }
        System.out.println("Book not found.");
    }
}

public class LibraryManagementSystem {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Library library = new Library();
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int choice;

        do {
            System.out.println("\nLibrary Management System");
            System.out.println("1. Add Book");
            System.out.println("2. View Books");
            System.out.println("3. Borrow Book");
            System.out.println("4. Return Book");
            System.out.println("5. Exit");
            System.out.print("Enter your choice: ");
            choice = scanner.nextInt();
            scanner.nextLine();  // Consume newline

            switch (choice) {
                case 1:
                    System.out.print("Enter book title: ");
                    String title = scanner.nextLine();
                    System.out.print("Enter author name: ");
                    String author = scanner.nextLine();
                    library.addBook(title, author);
                    break;
                case 2:
                    library.viewBooks();
                    break;
                case 3:
                    System.out.print("Enter the book title to borrow: ");
                    String borrowTitle = scanner.nextLine();
                    library.borrowBook(borrowTitle);
                    break;
                case 4:
                    System.out.print("Enter the book title to return: ");
                    String returnTitle = scanner.nextLine();
                    library.returnBook(returnTitle);
                    break;
                case 5:
                    System.out.println("Exiting Library System...");
                    break;
                default:
                    System.out.println("Invalid choice. Please try again.");
            }
        } while (choice != 5);

        scanner.close();
    }
}
How to Run the Code:
Copy and paste the code into a .java file (e.g., LibraryManagementSystem.java).
Compile the Java file using:
nginx
Copy
Edit
javac LibraryManagementSystem.java
Run the program:
nginx
Copy
Edit
java LibraryManagementSystem
Follow the on-screen options to manage books in the library.

Library Management System - Project Description
Objective:
The Library Management System is a simple console-based Java application that allows users to manage books in a library. The system provides functionalities to add books, view available books, borrow books, and return borrowed books.

Features:
Add Books

Users can add books by entering the book title and author.
The book gets stored in the library system.
View Available Books

Displays all books in the library along with their availability status.
Borrow Books

Users can borrow a book by entering the title.
If the book is available, it gets marked as "Borrowed."
If the book is already borrowed, the system notifies the user.
Return Books

Users can return a borrowed book by entering the title.
The book status is updated back to "Available."
Exit System

Allows users to exit the application when theyâ€™re done.
Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Java
Data Structure: ArrayList (for storing books)
User Input Handling: Scanner Class
OOP Concepts Used:
Encapsulation (using private fields and public methods)
Classes & Objects (Book and Library classes)
How It Works:
When the program starts, a menu is displayed with options:

Add a book
View books
Borrow a book
Return a book
Exit
The user selects an option and provides necessary details (e.g., book title).

The system processes the request and updates the book list accordingly.

The loop continues until the user chooses to exit.

Why This Project?
Great for beginners to understand Java OOP.
Teaches basic data management using ArrayLists.
Helps in developing logic for real-world applications.
Would you like any enhancements, such as adding a database or a GUI? ðŸš€
